Description: The catalogo_ucs_BR package is designed to convert species occurrence data from the Jabot Geral, Jabot RB, Reflora, SpeciesLink and GBIF data portals into a more understandable format for use in preparing species listings for the Plant Catalog of Units of Brazilian Conservation.
    The package provides tools to verify and standardize scientific names of species, join duplicates and select species records as a voucher to compose lists of plant species in UCs in Brazil, promoting the dissemination of knowledge about biodiversity in protected areas.
